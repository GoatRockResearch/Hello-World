My backcountry skiing, climbing, hiking, biking and all-around good friend, Hiller, and I were/are advocates of "Light is Right." Now we live 1000+ miles apart and no longer get the chance to spend time in the backcountry as much as we once did. However, when we traveled in the backcountry as lightly as possible, climbing gear was anything but light, so we often left it home, but still wanted to tackle a peak. Being "hardmen", we could not just take the standard hiking route, we needed to find a challenging route that did not require gear: mountains goats knew just where to go and just where to step so we would watch for and use the routes they took when and where applicable. GoatRock was the name we bestowed on those paths. As for the Research, it references my past and present both in the backcountry, the archive, and in text editor that doing environmental and digital history requires.
